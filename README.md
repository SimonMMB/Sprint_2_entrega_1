MySQL queries

ðŸ“„ EXERCISES DESCRIPTION

- Solving MySQL queries from given data bases

ðŸ’» TECHNOLOGIES USED

- XAMPP package (PHP, Apache web server, MySQL database)
- Server version: 10.4.28-MariaDB
- Visual Studio Code
- Git/Github

ðŸ“‹ NOTE

- Of the six queries that were intended to be resolved by applying the LEFT & RIGHT JOIN clauses, I did not apply any JOIN to solve query number 2 (professors who are not associated to any department) and query number 5 (subjects that do not have an assigned professor) because for both of them the required information was contained in a single table.
